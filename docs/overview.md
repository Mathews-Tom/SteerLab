## ðŸŽ¯ Core Mission

To develop a **modular, extensible Python framework** that faithfully implements the activation steering methodology from Bo et al. (2024), enabling researchers and developers to build personalized chatbots with preference-based control.

The framework is architected with a clear separation between an **offline Steering Vector Generation Service** and an **online Steerable Inference Engine**. This design ensures that the computationally intensive process of vector creation does not impact the performance of the real-time inference service. The core vector computation is performed using **Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA)**, a robust and direct method for identifying preference directions in activation space.

## Key Objectives

1. **ðŸ”¬ Research Reproducibility**: Faithfully reproduce all experimental results from the original paper.
2. **ðŸ§© Modular Design**: Create reusable components for different aspects of activation steering.
3. **âš¡ Production Ready**: Support real-world deployment scenarios with robust interfaces.
4. **ðŸ”„ Extensible Architecture**: Allow for easy integration of new models, datasets, and preference dimensions.
5. **ðŸ“š Developer Friendly**: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for quick adoption.

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Reproduce computational experiments E1-E4 from the paper.
- âœ… Implement all three interface designs (SELECT, CALIBRATE, LEARN).
- âœ… Support all recommended models (StableLM, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen).
- âœ… Achieve performance parity with paper results.
- âœ… Enable custom preference dimensions and datasets.

## Supported Models

The framework is designed to be extensible to any HuggingFace compatible model. The models validated in the original research paper are:

| Model Family | Specific Models | Parameters |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **StableLM** | stablelm-21-6b-chat | 1.6B |
| **Gemma** | gemma-2-2b-it, gemma-2-9b-it | 2B, 9B |
| **Mistral** | Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 | 7B |
| **Qwen** | Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct | 7B |
